# Welcome to IOM Open Source Projects

## About IOM

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is committed to advancing the understanding and management of migration through data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). By sharing our projects publicly, we aim to foster collaboration, innovation, and transparency in the field of migration studies.

## Why Open Source?

### Transparency and Trust
Open source projects allow us to be transparent about our methodologies and findings. This transparency builds trust with our stakeholders, including migrants, governments, and partner organizations.

### Collaboration and Innovation
By making our projects open source, we invite researchers, developers, and data scientists from around the world to collaborate with us. This collective effort accelerates innovation and helps us develop more effective solutions to migration challenges.

### Capacity Building
Open source projects serve as educational resources for those interested in data, analytics, and AI. By sharing our work, we contribute to the global knowledge base and help build capacity in these critical areas.
